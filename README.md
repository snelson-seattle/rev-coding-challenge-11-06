# Weekly Coding Challenge(s)

- Magic Index: A magic index in an array A [ 0 ... n -1] is defined to be an index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A.
  Follow up: What if the values are not distinct?
- Power Set: Write a method to return all subsets of a set.
- Recursive Multiply: Write a recursive function to multiply two positive integers without using the \*operator. You can use addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, but you should minimize the number of those operations.
